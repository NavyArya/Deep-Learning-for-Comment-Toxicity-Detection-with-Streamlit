# Deep-Learning-for-Comment-Toxicity-Detection-with-Streamlit
This project develops a deep learning model using BERT for detecting toxic comments in online platforms. It preprocesses text, fine-tunes BERT for classification, and deploys an interactive web app with Streamlit to identify toxic content in real time, supporting both single and bulk predictions.
